Getting Started
---------------
Before getting started with leo, you need to set up AWS credentials. There are several different ways to do this:

* Environment variables
* Shared credentials file
* Config file
* IAM Role

However, the recommended way is to install [aws-cli](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli) and running the `aws configure` command.
